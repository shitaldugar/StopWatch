# 1.General Information
This stopwatch is used to measure the time interval of an event. It is a kind of watch that stands out for the accuracy and precision with which it can measure the time of an event. It works by pressing a start button and then stopping it. We can reset it . I am providing this stopwatch to play events and have some fun and learnings as well.
